Projectâ€™s Overview :
This project aims to develop a Snake Game  using Assembly Language .It is a classic arcade-style game where player controls a snake to collect coins,avoid walls, and prevent self collision.It features speed selection, random coin generation, real-time input handling, and a scoreboard to track scores, offering a fun and interactive low-level programming experience.The goal of this project is to create a fully functional arcade game with basic mechanics while understanding the intricacies of assembly language.

Goals and Objectives :
Enhance understanding of Assembly Language : Gain in depth knowledge of low-level programming concepts,including memory management, and performance optimization.
Core Gameplay Mechanics : Develop a playable Snake Game with basic functionality: movement, scoring, and collision detection.
User Input Handling : Handle user inputs efficiently to update the snake's direction in real-time.
Speed Selection : Provide speed selection options to adjust gameplay difficulty.
Lives System :  Include features like score tracking and a restart/exit option for replayability.

Project Components :
Game speed selection
Random generation of coins
Accepting keyboard input
Move snake
Coin detection
Eat coin
Self collision and wall collision detection
Scoreboard
Input validation




Technologies :
Programming Language : Assembly Language
Assembler : MASM

Expected Outcome :
Functional Game Mechanics: The Snake Game will feature essential mechanics like snake movement, food collection, and collision detection, implemented entirely using assembly language code.
User Interaction: Players will interact with the game through keyboard inputs to control the snake's direction, demonstrating effective input handling and dynamic gameplay in assembly language.
Graphical Output: The game will display visually appealing graphics, using low-level programming to render the snake, food, and game environment effectively.
Implementation of COAL Fundamentals: The project will successfully implement core concepts such as loops for game logic, jumps for control flow, and variable declarations for game state management.
Performance Optimization: The game will be optimized to run efficiently on minimal system resources, showcasing the power of assembly language in creating high-performance real-time applications.

Conclusion :
This project, an engaging and interactive Snake Game, demonstrates the practical application of core concepts in COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language), including loops, conditional jumps, arrays,and real-time user input handling. It exemplifies a significant industrial undertaking by integrating essential elements of game development, such as collision detection, user interaction,and event-driven programming. The project offers a hands-on approach to understanding the mechanics of low-level game programming, emphasizing efficient resource management,and real-time processing.
